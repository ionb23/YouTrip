## Description 

This website presents an easy timetable manager which allows the user to manage their daily activities. 
Functionality was built using Javascript, which enables the user to dynamically see the current date at the top of the page through moment.js, enter events in the according timeslot and save events to local storage so they persist through webpage refreshes. Moment.js was also used to change color of timeblock depending on current time of the day.
